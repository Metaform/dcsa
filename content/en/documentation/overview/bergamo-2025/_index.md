## Bergamo, Italy, Oct 6th & 7th, 2025


#### After our first technical workshop earlier in June, the European Cloud Accelerator (ECA) community is reconveningâ€”this time at Arubaâ€™s Global Datacenter headquarters in **Bergamo, Italy** specifically in Aruba Auditorium, Via S. Clemente, 53, 24036 Ponte San Pietro BG, on **Monday 6 & Tuesday 7 October 2025**.
#### The ECAâ€™s mission remains unchanged: to turn trusted, sovereign and interoperable data-sharing into everyday reality for European industry. Our next gathering will move us from concepts to concrete deploymentsâ€”bringing business leaders and engineers together under one (very large) roof. We will share progress on the [Open Source Eclipse Data Components project](https://github.com/eclipse-edc), which already serves as the base of the Catena-X platform supporting European dataspace initiative.
