## TECHNICAL TRACK ‚Äì MONDAY

### Technical Track for **Developers**

#### ‚è∞ 10:30‚Äì10:45 ‚Äî ECA Technical Track Kick-off
**Owner/Presenter:** Babak Jahromi / Thomas  

**Abstract:**  
Kick-off the two-day technical track. Describe a brief history of ECA, refer attendees to the pre-read covering Milan workshop, and set the stage for the two-day technical workshop, its tracks, goals, and the hands-on nature of the developer track. 

- Track 1 for developers
- Trak 2 for technical decision makers and program managers

Engineering focused collaboration to help B2B data sharing across Europe based on EU requirements and ideas. It is an OSS initiative and its output is ultimately code that participants can build a product out of.

The tracks are meant to be collaborative and interactive. No long lectures. It should be a discussion. Each session will have a lead/facilitator who starts up the session and guides conversations. Everyone needs to engage.

#### ‚è∞ 10:45‚Äì11:30 ‚Äî White-label Management UI for EDC
**Presenter:** Marco (Aruba)  

**Abstract:**  
This session will introduce the new "white label" workload management UI that simplifies onboarding and operations for Eclipse Dataspace Components, evolving the project from single-tenant connectors to a multi-tenant, SaaS-ready platform. The UI, contributed as open source, enables organizations to set up, configure, and manage dataspace connectors with ease across hybrid and multi-cloud environments. Attendees will see how this approach lowers adoption barriers, enhances user experience, and provides a reusable foundation that any adopter can customize for their needs.

Will it offer telemetry about the state of EDC workload, its clusters/cells, their  health, etc. It should also include metering and billing interfaces to support billing of the tenants/customers.

This session will include a demo showcasing integration with the south-bound APIs to mount multi-tenant EDC onto Aruba's cloud infrastructure.
