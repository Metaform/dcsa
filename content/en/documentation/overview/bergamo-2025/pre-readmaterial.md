# Welcome to the European Cloud Accelerator Workshop â€“ Bergamo 2025  

After our energizing workshop in Milan, we are thrilled to welcome you to the next gathering of the **European Cloud Accelerator (ECA)** community. This time, we will meet at **Arubaâ€™s Global Datacenter headquarters in Bergamo, Italy, on Monday 6 & Tuesday 7 October 2025**.  

The mission of the ECA remains clear: **to make trusted, sovereign, and interoperable data sharing a practical reality for European industry.** In Bergamo, we will move from concepts to deployments â€“ connecting business leaders, engineers, and standards bodies under one roof.
