# Milan Workshop Summary – June 2025

The European Cloud Accelerator community gathered in Milan in June 2025 for a multi-day workshop focused on advancing the vision of open, sovereign, and interoperable data spaces. The event brought together cloud providers, industrial data experts, open-source contributors, and policymakers to align efforts and accelerate progress across the ecosystem.

## Key Themes

### 🌍 Trusted Data Sharing at Scale
Trust emerged as the foundation for everything discussed. Participants emphasized that scalable data sharing across industries and borders requires verifiable identities, enforceable policies, and peer-to-peer exchange models that respect sovereignty.

> _"Your data, your choice — with great responsibility comes great power."_  
> — echoed across sessions as a guiding principle

### 🏗️ Technical Foundation: Eclipse Dataspace Components (EDC)
Demos and deep dives showcased how EDC can enable data spaces to operate across cloud, on-premises, and edge environments. Attendees explored how to deploy, extend, and contribute to EDC as a modular open-source stack.

Focus areas included:
- Multi-tenant EDC architectures
- Federated catalog and control plane evolution
- Deployment patterns across Azure, Fulcrum, and Opiquad-hosted clouds

### 🤝 Industry and Ecosystem Alignment
Leaders from Catena-X, Manufacturing-X, IDSA, iSHARE, and the OPC Foundation shared how they are building production-grade data spaces with real-world constraints:
- Automotive, supply chain, and energy sectors are prioritizing interoperability and self-sovereign identity
- Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) must be first-class citizens, with minimal onboarding friction
- Cross-domain and international cooperation is essential — “no one wants to onboard to five data spaces five different ways”

### 🧱 Standards and Regulation
With the EU Data Act taking effect, aligning with emerging standards became a top priority. Topics included:
- The upcoming harmonized European standards for data spaces (per Article 33)
- Profiles and protocols from the Eclipse DSSC working group
- Integration of OPC UA, AAS, and policy enforcement models across layers

## Takeaways & Next Steps

Babak Jahromi summarized the spirit of the workshop:

> _"We’ve come far — now everyone must ask: how do I plug in, and how do I contribute? Some of us will work on multi-tenancy. Others can test binaries in their native environment. The path is emerging."_

### Immediate Actions
- ✅ Test and deploy EDC in your own environment (Docker, Azure, Opiquad, etc.)
- ✅ Join a working group (EDC, DSSC, Gaia-X, IDSA)
- ✅ Contribute use cases, feedback, and reference integrations
- ✅ Plan for migration paths — data spaces are now running in production
