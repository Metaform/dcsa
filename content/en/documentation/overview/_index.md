# European Cloud Accelerator

## Introduction

The **European Cloud Accelerator (ECA)** is a collaborative initiative to enable a new era of *trusted, sovereign, and interoperable data sharing* across Europe‚Äôs digital landscape.

At its core, the ECA is about helping organizations across sectors‚Äîpublic, private, and academic‚Äîbuild and adopt **data spaces**: decentralized, policy-driven ecosystems where data can be shared under clear terms, across company and cloud boundaries, without losing control or sovereignty.

## Why It Matters

Data is the raw material of the digital economy‚Äîbut it only becomes valuable when it is *shared and reused*. Traditional models of isolated data silos and central platforms no longer serve the needs of interconnected supply chains, cross-border regulation, or AI development.

The European Cloud Accelerator aims to:

- **Scale data spaces as-a-service** across Europe‚Äôs cloud and edge infrastructure
- **Create economic opportunities** for European cloud and technology providers
- **Support compliance** with key European legislation (e.g. the Data Act, Digital Product Passport, Carbon Accounting)
- **Foster innovation** in AI, sustainability, manufacturing, logistics, and beyond

## Guiding Principles

We follow several core principles inspired by shared values across the European data and cloud communities:

1. **Trust-by-design**  
   Data spaces establish trust between participants using verifiable credentials, usage policies, and decentralized identity mechanisms.

2. **Your data, your rules**  
   Data sovereignty means participants stay in control of who uses their data, how, for how long, and where. Data doesn‚Äôt flow through intermediaries‚Äîit flows peer-to-peer.

3. **Interoperability at every level**  
   We support open standards (e.g. ISO 20151, DSP, DCP, OPC UA) and open protocols to ensure data and services can connect across domains, providers, and national borders.

4. **Open source as foundation**  
   Core building blocks‚Äîlike the Eclipse Dataspace Components‚Äîare open, modular, and extensible. This fosters shared innovation and avoids lock-in.

5. **Decentralization and neutrality**  
   There is no central authority. Governance is defined by the community, and services are federated across cloud providers, industries, and countries.

## The Work Ahead

The ECA is not a top-down project‚Äîit‚Äôs a community of contributors working across multiple layers:

- **Cloud and Edge providers**: Offering scalable, sovereign infrastructure for hosting data spaces
- **Software developers and open-source communities**: Building and extending reusable components
- **Standards bodies and policymakers**: Shaping regulation and interoperability frameworks
- **Industry consortia and domain experts**: Defining real-world use cases and requirements
- **End users**: Bringing adoption, feedback, and demand

## Join the Movement

Everyone has a role to play‚Äîwhether you're a cloud provider, startup, regulator, researcher, or industrial partner. The European Cloud Accelerator is a **shared, long-term journey** to transform how data is shared, trusted, and monetized in Europe.

Let‚Äôs build it‚Äîtogether.
