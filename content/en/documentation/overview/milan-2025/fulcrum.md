**Fulcrum** is an open-source, European initiative designed to transform the fragmented landscape of local cloud providers into a unified, federated **‚Äúcloud continuum.‚Äù**  
It enables regional cloud and telecom providers to **commercially trade compute, network, and higher-level services** while maintaining **sovereignty**, **interoperability**, and **compliance** with emerging EU trust and data regulations.

## üîß How the Project is Organised

| **Layer**              | **What it Does**                                                                                   | **Key Artefacts**                                                                                                                                         |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Governance**      | Provides the neutral consensus room for technical and business rule-making                         | **InterCloud Exchange (ICE) Foundation** ‚Äì governs specifications, public repositories, and defines the open-source stack                                |
| **2. Execution**       | Matches supply and demand for infrastructure and services across providers                         | **Computing Exchange Market (CEM)** ‚Äì handles onboarding, metering, billing, SLA evidence for cross-provider transactions                                |
| **3. Technology Core** | Federates cloud infrastructure across providers                                                    | **Fulcrum Core** ‚Äì Apache 2.0 licensed OSS that enables CSPs to expose services into the exchange via gateway-based federation                           |
| **4. Digital Ecosystem** | Supports CMPs, app platforms, and higher-level services                                            | **Open APIs**, a service catalogue, built-in support for **notarisation** and **Industrial Dataspace Agent** to enforce policies with workloads          |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architectural Principles

- **Open & Vendor-Neutral**: All code released under Apache 2.0; governance decisions via ICE Foundation  
- **Federated & Edge-Ready**: Each provider retains their PoPs; optimized for proximity and locality  
- **Wholesale-Only Model**: Fulcrum is B2B only‚Äînever resells to end-users  
- **Built-in Compliance**: Identity, policy, and audit hooks aligned with the **EU Data Act** and **Cloud Regulation**

## üí° Why It Matters (and Where Opiquad Fits)

| **Challenge Today**                         | **What Fulcrum Adds**                                                                 | **Opiquad‚Äôs Role**                                                                                       |
|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Local CSPs losing share to hyperscalers    | Enables a **cloud continuum exchange** for regional providers to monetize idle capacity | Early implementation partner validating Fulcrum Core and CEM with **real service trades**                |
| Interoperability ends at IaaS APIs         | Gateway and policy engine unifies **IaaS, PaaS, and data-space agents**                | Contributes adapters and **Industrial Dataspace Agent** to integrate enterprise-grade data exchange       |
| High trust/compliance overhead for SMEs    | ICE Foundation provides shared credentials and billing stack                           | Ensures open-source artefacts meet **EU regulatory** and **sovereignty** requirements for Opiquad clients |

## üö¶ Current Status

- ‚úÖ **Fulcrum Core** public release complete; Framework Lab evaluates tech before promotion to Core  
- ‚úÖ **CEM MVP** live with API onboarding, billing, and metering across multiple CSPs  
- üîú **2025‚Äì2026 Roadmap** includes:
  - Multi-cloud policy propagation  
  - Automated edge workload placement  
  - Full alignment with **EU Data Act** and **CISPE Code of Conduct**

## üß≠ Take-away

**Fulcrum is not another proprietary cloud** ‚Äî it's the **missing exchange layer** that allows hundreds of European-scale and regional providers to operate **as one hyperscale platform**, while retaining control over their infrastructure, customer relationships, and compliance.  

**Opiquad** plays a pivotal role in operationalizing this vision through contributions in:
- Open-source architecture hardening  
- Industrial-grade policy enforcement  
- EU-trusted data exchange
