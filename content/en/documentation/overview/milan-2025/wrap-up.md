# Wrap-up and Next Steps  
📅 June 30, 2025 | 🕖 07:43

## 🔍 High-Level Wrap-Up

### ✅ What We Set Out To Do
- Bring the dataspace and EU-cloud communities together to align on vision, terminology, and key pain points
- Validate the **“dataspace-as-a-service”** opportunity for European cloud providers
- Kick off **concrete OSS workstreams** that any provider can adopt and monetize
- Map the **standards landscape** to build once and interoperate everywhere

### 🛠 What We Achieved in Two Intense Days
- 27+ organizations (cloud providers, SIs, SMEs, standards bodies) aligned on:
  - Shared roadmaps
  - Demos and open-source assets
  - Common vocabulary (e.g., control plane ≠ data plane, multilevel policies)

- Confirmed market demand:
  - Catena-X, Manufacturing-X, iSHARE, OPC Foundation, etc.
  - Need for **hosted, multi-tenant EDC offerings** (1M+ potential SME tenants)

- Demos and deliverables:
  - **Minimum Viable Dataspace**
  - **Industrial data plane**
  - **Multi-cloud deployment scripts**
  - Roadmap agreed for:
    - Virtualised EDC (EDC-V)
    - Connector Fabric Manager
    - Industrial Data Plane
    - Management Portal (M1 release target: Oct 2025)

- Standards alignment:
  - Walk-throughs: ISO/IEC 20151, CEN JTC 25 “Trusted Data Transactions”, Eclipse DSP & DCP, OPC UA Cloud
  - Commitment to submit Eclipse specs as ISO PAS and contribute to CEN test kits

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

1. **Trust is the currency**  
   Multilevel policies (membership → access → contract → usage) must be machine-verifiable across cloud and dataspace boundaries.

2. **No single vendor wins alone**  
   Open standards and OSS reference code must be adopted collaboratively.

3. **Small-company onboarding is the KPI**  
   “One-click tenant creation, zero-click upgrades” is the goal for EDC next-gen.

4. **Standards now carry legal weight**  
   Q3 2025 Data-Act standardization request will bring conformance testing into the core feature set.

## 🧩 Medium-Term Workstreams (Open for Joiners)

1. **Connector Fabric Manager**  
   Kubernetes operator + workflow engine to place tenants on federated EU clouds

2. **Industrial Data Plane**  
   High-throughput data flows (OPC UA, AAS REST, bulk objects) with enforcement hooks

3. **Management Portal**  
   Unified provider UI: onboarding wizard, SLA dashboard, usage-based billing

4. **Compliance Toolkit**  
   Automated conformance tools for **Data Act Article 33/36**

## 📅 Next Gathering

> _“We’re looking forward to having another version of this workshop in October…  
Think about location – Munich was mentioned – we need Wi-Fi and good supply 😊.  
Alexis will follow up with logistics.”_
