# Keynote – Prof. Boris Otto (Fraunhofer ISST)

## Summary

Prof. Boris Otto delivered a keynote focused on the essential role of **data spaces** and **trust-based data sharing** as foundational elements in Europe's digital and AI future. His main points included:

- **Data sharing is not an end**, but a mechanism to unlock value across ecosystems.
- Emphasized **three principles**: reuse, fairness (reciprocity), and trust.
- **Trust** must exist in both the participants and the data itself (quality, control, and rights).
- **Data spaces** are the enabling framework for trusted data sharing—built on interoperability, metadata, policies, and governance.
- Referenced **CEN/CENELEC JTC 25**, **IDSA**, **Gaia-X**, and **ISO 20151** as standardization anchors.
- Positioned **data spaces** across a **cloud-edge continuum**, from hyperscalers to edge nodes.
- Highlighted the importance of **basic data objects** (e.g., product and organizational metadata) to enable a **digital twin of the European market**.
- Connected data spaces with **Europe’s AI ambitions**, especially the concept of **AI Gigafactories** and **data labs**, where trustful data sharing is a prerequisite for foundation models.

> _"Data is a treasure, but it only has value if used—and used fairly, transparently, and with trust."_

**Boris Otto · Keynote Speech · European Cloud Accelerator Technical Workshop · 4 June 2025**

### Introduction

It is a pleasure for me to take this opportunity and share some thoughts with you about data spaces and data sharing in the cloud. I want to cover three points:  
1. Why data sharing is important and not an end in itself.  
2. The role of data spaces as tools to share data while ensuring trust and sovereignty.  
3. A vision of how cloud-based data spaces will evolve.

### Data Sharing Rationale

The **EU data strategy** is built around principles that remain true today:
- **Data is a strategic resource** for competitiveness and sustainability.
- **Data is only valuable if reused** — value often arises later in the “data value chain.”
- There must be **balance and reciprocity** between data providers and consumers.
- **Trust** is fundamental and comes in two forms:
  - Trust **between participants** in a dynamic ecosystem.
  - Trust **in the data** itself — quality, rights, usage control.

### Data Spaces

The **Data Spaces Support Centre** defines data spaces as **interoperable frameworks** with shared rules, standards, and governance to enable **trusted data transactions**.

A **trusted data transaction** includes:
1. Rights granted by the data rights holder
2. Metadata publication
3. Data discovery
4. Negotiation
5. Exchange
6. Use

Referenced standards and protocols:
- **CEN/CENELEC JTC 25**
- **IDSA Data Space Protocol**
- **Decentralized Claims Protocol**
- **ISO 20151**

The ecosystem includes:
- **IDSA**, **Gaia-X**, **OPC UA**, and **EDWG** for implementation and standardization
- Alignment across initiatives (e.g., IDSA and IDTA convergence)

Otto emphasized the importance of two **basic data objects**:
- **Organization data** (e.g., names, registrations, certificates)
- **Product data** (e.g., lifecycle, reusability, technical specs)

These objects underpin a **digital twin of the European Single Market**.

### Edge-Cloud Continuum

Cloud is the backbone of the modern economy—and by extension, of data ecosystems. Otto envisions:
- A mix of **large cloud platforms** and **many edge/cloud service providers**
- Edge computing integrated into vehicles, production lines, etc.
- Cloud ecosystems, as discussed in Gaia-X, bridging this continuum

Fraunhofer’s research (e.g., Cognitive Internet Technologies) supports this infrastructure.

### AI and Europe’s Future

Data spaces will be vital for Europe’s **AI transformation**:
- Foundation models need: **models, skills, funding, infrastructure, and data**
- Europe has these—**but they’re distributed**
- The concept of **AI Gigafactories** introduces **data labs** that prepare data for AI use
- Data sharing for AI requires **trust and fairness** — which data spaces enable

### Closing

Prof. Otto closed by reiterating the importance of collective alignment and trust. Without it, data’s potential for innovation—especially in AI—cannot be fully realized.

> _"Thank you for your attention. Let’s continue building the infrastructure that makes trusted data sharing real."_
