# Industry Partners  
üìÖ June 28, 2025 | üïò 09:24  

This session featured insights from key industry leaders and initiatives shaping trusted, interoperable, and sovereign data sharing across sectors.

## 1. Thomas Obermeyer ‚Äì Catena-X

**Origin & Vision:**  
Started as a German government-funded research initiative, Catena-X has evolved into a global operational network coordinated by the Catena-X Association.

**Scope:**  
Focused on the **automotive industry**, involving OEMs (BMW, Mercedes-Benz, VW) and suppliers, with hubs in North America, APAC, China, and Spain.

**Key Principles:**
- **Decentralization**: Peer-to-peer data sharing with no central storage
- **Trust and Governance**: Policies to prevent misuse of sensitive data (e.g., defect or capacity information)
- **Interoperability**: Avoids lock-in to isolated data spaces

**Architecture:**  
Uses connectors, trust-anchoring services, and promotes open-source tools (e.g., Tractos-X)

**Future Focus:**
- Scaling to **SMEs**
- **Multi-tenant EDC** deployment
- Governance frameworks for **critical data flow migration**

## 2. Thomas Hahn ‚Äì Manufacturing-X

**Mission:**  
Enhance **resilience, sustainability, and competitiveness** in post-pandemic manufacturing

**Integration:**  
Bridges cross-sector initiatives like Catena-X with domains such as **chemicals**, **semiconductors**, and **energy**

**Key Use Case:**  
**Battery Passport** ‚Äì tracking material lifecycle via EDC, OPC UA, and international standards

**Global Alignment:**  
Engages with SESAME (USA), and partners in **Canada, Japan, Korea**

**Joint Services:**  
Developing shared infrastructure for smart manufacturing, **OPC-based standards**, and product passporting

## 3. Stefan Hoppe ‚Äì OPC Foundation

**OPC UA:**  
Vendor-neutral, open standard for **secure, interoperable industrial data exchange** from sensor to cloud

**Focus Areas:**
- **Semantic modeling** of operational/business data (e.g., robots, machines)
- **No IP/licensing barriers**, supporting open-source legal safety

**Cloud Initiative:**  
Joint reference architecture launched with AWS, Microsoft, SAP, and Google for data ingestion, modeling, and AI

**Complementarity:**  
OPC addresses **semantic/interoperability** but not data sovereignty‚Äîmaking it synergistic with data space frameworks

## 4. Sebastian Steinbuss ‚Äì IDSA (International Data Spaces Association)

**Standards Focus:**
- Leading conceptual and technical standards for **trusted, interoperable data sharing**
- Driving **ISO/IEC 20151**, which defines data spaces

**Key Features:**
- **Policy Enforcement** across law, contracts, and usage lifecycle
- **Decentralized Trust**: No central intermediaries
- **Eclipse EDC** as open-source reference implementation

**Compliance Alignment:**  
Closely tied to the **EU Data Act (Article 33)** with active standardization engagement

## 5. Rajiv Rajani ‚Äì iSHARE Trust Framework

**Goal:**  
Organizational **data sovereignty** ‚Äî _‚ÄúYour data, your choice.‚Äù_

**Framework Capabilities:**
- Validates **identity, authentication, authorization**, and usage policies
- Supports **decentralized authorization** via registries

**Use Case:**  
**Dutch sustainability data space**
