  Erich Barnstedt’s session focused on the urgent need for **interoperable, standardized digital infrastructures in manufacturing**, driven by the upcoming **2027 Digital Product Passport (DPP)** regulation. He emphasized the critical role of **open source**, **semantic standards**, and **industry collaboration** to enable compliance, resilience, and new business opportunities—especially for small and medium-sized manufacturers.

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

### 📘 Digital Product Passport (DPP)
- Mandatory from **2027** for all products sold in Europe
- Must include data on:
  - Recyclability
  - Carbon footprint
  - Supply chain
  - Personnel
- Use cases: **Battery Passports**, **Digital Nameplates**

### 🔗 Interoperability Requires 4 Standardized Elements
- **Interface** (e.g., REST / OpenAPI)
- **Data Format** (e.g., OPC UA Nodeset)
- **Data Model** (e.g., OPC UA Modelling Language)
- **Semantics** (e.g., AAS Submodel Templates)

### 🤝 Standardization & Collaboration
- Industry aligned around:
  - **OPC UA**
  - **Asset Administration Shell (AAS)**
  - **Eclipse Dataspace Connector (EDC)**
- Microsoft contributed **6–8 million lines of open source code** to these initiatives

### 🧪 Proof of Concept
- A **DPP for paper** was built
  - Highlighted difficulty in capturing **carbon footprint data**
  - Noted that **90% of emissions** come from supply chains, not energy use

### 🏭 Small & Medium Manufacturer Opportunity
- SMEs often lack internal IT
- Opportunity for **cloud providers and software vendors** to support compliance

### 🧰 Smart Manufacturing Profile Designer
- Open-source tool by **CESMII**
- Enables DPP creation using **400+ templates**
- Designed for users with **minimal IT skills**

### ☁️ Edge-to-Cloud Integration
- DPPs must function across **cloud and edge**
- EDC enables **cross-platform**, **peer-to-peer**, **decentralized data sharing**

### 🌐 IEC Standardization
- IEC **TC65** forming a working group to:
  - Create international standards based on **AAS**, **OPC UA**, and **EDC**

## 💬 Quotes from the Session

> “Open source and standards are two sides of the same coin.”

> “You can’t build a product carbon footprint without carbon data from your entire supply chain.”

> “Somebody with zero to weak IT skills should be able to use it — and that’s the challenge.”
