     Intro to Dataspaces, General Data Sharing Scenarios, and Feedback Solicitation – Eric Samson

# Intro to Dataspaces, General Data Sharing Scenarios, and Feedback Solicitation  
**Speaker:** Eric Samson (Microsoft)

Eric Samson introduced foundational data space concepts, focusing on how trust mechanisms reduce risk when sharing data across organizational and technical boundaries.

## Key Points

- **Data value is created through sharing**, but the risk increases as data leaves its origin.
- **Data spaces reduce risk** by building trust across three core layers:
  - **Legal**: Jurisdictional compliance
  - **Economic**: Billing, invoicing, marketplaces
  - **Technical**: Peer-to-peer architecture using open protocols and connectors

- **Policies and claims** enable participants to define usage constraints and verify identity.
- The **Eclipse Dataspace Connector (EDC)** is the open-source engine that underpins these architectures.
- **Architectural principles** include:
  - Decentralization
  - Interoperability
  - Multi-cloud support
  - No reliance on centralized data lakes

- **Use cases supported**:
  - Supply chain transparency
  - Sustainability reporting
  - Training for large language models (LLMs)

- **Global momentum**:
  - 80+ active projects in Spain
  - Over 100 initiatives in China
